*The Legend of VB - Run From Magpie*


Welcome to The Legend of VB - Run From Magpie! This game was created as part of my learning journey with Godot, and I’ve decided to make it open-source so others can explore and learn from it too.

Game Overview
In The Legend of VB - Run From Magpie, you control Bogan, who must navigate a pixelated world while avoiding the relentless attacks of magpies. The goal is to survive as long as possible while collecting VB bottles to restore your health.

This is a simple, fast-paced prototype designed to practice Godot, focusing on core mechanics like movement, health systems, and obstacle evasion.

*Features*

1.W-A-S-D Movement for controlling Bogan’s character.

2.Health System: Collect VB bottles scattered throughout the level to restore health.

3.Magpie Enemies: Evade or outmaneuver the magpies to stay alive.

4.Simple pixel art and minimalist design to keep things light and focused on gameplay mechanics.

*Installation*

1.Clone or download the repository.

2.Open the project in Godot 4.3 (or a compatible version).

3.Run the project to play the game.
